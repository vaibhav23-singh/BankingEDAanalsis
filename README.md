# 🏦 Banking Analysis Project using MySQL and Python

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing banking data using **Python** and **MySQL** to extract insights into customer behavior, loan statistics, transaction patterns, and more. The analysis helps banks make data-driven decisions to improve services and customer satisfaction.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.8+**
* **MySQL 8.0+**
* **Pandas**
* **MySQL Connector for Python (`mysql-connector-python`)**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## 📂 Database Schema

The database contains the following tables:

* `customers` – Customer details (age, gender, region, etc.)
* `accounts` – Bank accounts and types
* `transactions` – Transaction logs
* `loans` – Loan applications and statuses

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/banking-analysis.git
cd banking-analysis
```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set Up MySQL Database**

* Start your MySQL server.
* Open a MySQL client and run:

```sql
SOURCE data/bank_data.sql;
```

This will create the database and populate it with sample data.

4. **Configure Environment**

Set up your MySQL credentials in a `.env` file:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=bank_db

## 📈 Key Analysis Performed

* Customer demographics distribution
* Average account balances by region and gender
* Monthly transaction volumes and patterns
* Loan approval rates and default analysis
* High-value customers and their activity

## 📊 Sample Output

* Bar charts showing transaction trends
* Pie charts of loan approval status
* Correlation matrix of financial indicators
